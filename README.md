# Project

I am applying for Junior Front End Developer. I just want to learn and work with a team.
It was the first time I have ever did something using HTML + CSS. 
I know that those codes may be not too good, but honestly I started just a week ago. Everything was new to me, even github.
I hope that with every code (from project 1-1 to 1-3) it looks better and better (less like spaghetti code). 
There are a couple of mistakes, and errors. 

Hope that you Reader, could get through this.

Cheers!
